# Titanic Survival Prediction using Machine Learning

![Titanic](app/static/img/titanic.png)
This project is about predicting the survival of passengers on the Titanic using machine learning. The dataset used in this project is the Titanic dataset from Kaggle. The dataset contains information about the passengers on the Titanic and whether they survived or not. The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that can predict whether a passenger survived or not based on the information available in the dataset.

> The project is related to Filoger MLOps School.
